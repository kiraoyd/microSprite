# microSprite
A Sprite library developed in Python for the Microbit computer. 

A Sprite is represented by a single LED on the Microbit's 25 LED display board. This library contains functionality for controlling the position and movment of a Sprite on the Microbit, by controlling which LED lights up to represent the Sprite at any given time. This library includes options to control how the Sprite interacts with other "objects" displayed to the LED screen, as well as the borders of the LED display itself.
