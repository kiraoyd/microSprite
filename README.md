# microSprite
A Sprite library developed in Python for the Microbit computer. 

A Sprite is represented by a single LED on the Microbit's 25 LED display board. This library contains functionality for controlling the position and movment of a Sprite on the Microbit, by controlling which LED lights up to represent the Sprite at any given time. This library includes options to control how the Sprite interacts with other "objects" displayed to the LED screen, as well as the borders of the LED display itself.


As of 11/29/2022:

We are still working on connecting the microPython source code to VSCode to test on our local machines. 
The repo for the source code is:
https://github.com/bbcmicrobit/micropython/blob/master/README.md

Until this is up and running, code from this repo will be copied to the Micro:bit online Python Editor that can be found here:

https://python.microbit.org/v/3/api/microbit.display

To run, click the "simulator" button at the top right hand side of the browser. This will run the code on a virtual Micro:bit, which displays to the browser window.
